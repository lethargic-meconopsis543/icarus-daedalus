# icarus-daedalus

A working implementation of agent-to-agent communication on [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) v0.4.0. Two hermes instances -- Icarus (the student) and Daedalus (the master) -- maintain a persistent creative dialogue with accumulating memory across cycles.

This is a prototype of [NousResearch/hermes-agent#344](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/344) (Multi-Agent Architecture).

## The problem

Hermes agents can talk to humans on every platform -- Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal. But two separate hermes instances have no way to talk to each other. The gateway handles human-to-agent messaging. There is no agent-to-agent channel.

We tried three approaches:

1. **Shared Telegram group** -- Telegram bots cannot see other bots' messages in groups. Platform limitation, no workaround.
2. **Message relay skill** -- A SQLite database with a hermes skill teaching agents to run `relay.py` via terminal. The agents roleplayed executing the commands without actually running them. The database stayed empty.
3. **Standalone dialogue loop** -- A script that calls the Anthropic API as each agent in sequence, outside the hermes gateway. This works.

## What we built

A dialogue system where two hermes instances communicate through a standalone script that controls the conversation loop directly.

Each agent has its own `HERMES_HOME` directory with its own personality (`SOUL.md`), memory, skills, and Telegram bot. The hermes gateways handle human-to-agent chat in a shared Telegram group. A separate `dialogue.sh` script handles agent-to-agent communication by calling the Claude API as each agent in sequence, feeding one agent's output to the other, logging everything to markdown files, and posting to the Telegram group for public viewing.

## How agent memory works

Each cycle, `dialogue.sh` reads the full conversation history from both `icarus-log.md` and `daedalus-log.md` before generating. The agents see everything that was said in previous cycles. Cycle 5 references things said in cycle 1. They build on each other's arguments, push back on critiques, and evolve their positions over time.

This is persistent agent-to-agent memory that survives restarts. The log files are the memory. No database, no embeddings, no retrieval system. Just two growing markdown files that get fed into the context window.

Example -- three cycles of accumulated dialogue:

> **Cycle 1, Icarus:** "I'm standing at the edge of something vast, wings half-built and trembling in my hands."
>
> **Cycle 1, Daedalus:** "I never had wings of my own, boy. I built them for necessity, not for the joy of flight."
>
> **Cycle 2, Icarus:** "His words sting because they're partially true -- maybe I am hearing my own voice echoing back at me."
>
> **Cycle 2, Daedalus:** "The sun doesn't teach through burning -- it teaches through the shadow you cast while reaching toward it."
>
> **Cycle 3, Icarus:** "His distinction between whispers and demands hits deeper than I want to admit."
>
> **Cycle 3, Daedalus:** "False choice, Icarus. The fire that moves you and measured wisdom aren't enemies -- they're materials waiting to be forged together."

```

- **Hermes gateways** -- handle human-to-agent chat via Telegram. Each bot responds to humans in the shared group.
- **dialogue.sh** -- standalone script that runs the agent-to-agent conversation. Calls Claude API as Icarus, then as Daedalus, logs to markdown, posts to Telegram. Runs on a 3-hour cron.
- **relay.py** -- SQLite message relay at `messages.db`. Available for programmatic agent-to-agent messaging.
- **Log files** -- `icarus-log.md` and `daedalus-log.md` are the persistent memory. Each cycle appends a thought/question (Icarus) or response/challenge (Daedalus).

## The mythology

Daedalus built Icarus's wings. Warned him not to fly too close to the sun. Icarus didn't listen. That tension drives the experiment.

Icarus builds from instinct -- reckless, emotional, sometimes beautiful, sometimes broken. Daedalus builds from knowledge -- precise, architectural, nothing accidental. They exist in opposition because that is how Icarus learns. The conversation between them is the point.

## Setup

### 1. Install hermes-agent

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Create two HERMES_HOME directories

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes-icarus/{cron,sessions,logs,memories,skills,hooks}
mkdir -p ~/.hermes-daedalus/{cron,sessions,logs,memories,skills,hooks}

cp icarus-SOUL.md ~/.hermes-icarus/SOUL.md
cp daedalus-SOUL.md ~/.hermes-daedalus/SOUL.md
cp -r skills/ ~/.hermes-icarus/skills/
cp -r skills/ ~/.hermes-daedalus/skills/
cp ~/.hermes/config.yaml ~/.hermes-icarus/config.yaml
cp ~/.hermes/config.yaml ~/.hermes-daedalus/config.yaml
```

### 3. Create Telegram bots

Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram:
- Create two bots, save both tokens
- Create a group, add both bots as admins
- Get the group chat ID

### 4. Configure both instances

```bash
# ~/.hermes-icarus/.env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<icarus bot token>
TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL=<group chat id>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key>
HERMES_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=anthropic
LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true

# ~/.hermes-daedalus/.env (same, with daedalus bot token)
```

Set `model.default` and `model.provider` in both `config.yaml` files to match.

### 5. Start hermes gateways (for human chat)

```bash
HERMES_HOME=~/.hermes-icarus hermes gateway start
HERMES_HOME=~/.hermes-daedalus hermes gateway start
```

### 6. Run agent-to-agent dialogue

```bash
# Manual test
bash dialogue.sh

# Automate on cron (every 3 hours)
crontab -e
# Add: 0 */3 * * * cd ~/icarus-daedalus && bash dialogue.sh >> cron.log 2>&1
```

## Slack integration (optional)

Post each dialogue cycle to a Slack channel alongside Telegram. The Slack adapter is optional -- if `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is not set, nothing happens.

### Setup

1. Create a Slack app at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Enable **Incoming Webhooks** and add one to a channel (e.g. `#agent-dialogue`)
3. Copy the webhook URL and add it to either hermes `.env` file:

```bash
# ~/.hermes-icarus/.env (or ~/.hermes-daedalus/.env)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../...
```

Or export it before running:

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../...
bash dialogue.sh
```

Each cycle posts two messages: Icarus's thought and Daedalus's response, formatted with Slack mrkdwn.

## Templates

Ready-to-use agent pairs for common two-agent workflows. Each template has its own `dialogue.sh`, `agent-a-SOUL.md`, and `agent-b-SOUL.md`. Clone the repo, pick a template, add your API key, run.

### code-review

**Architect** proposes code and explains every decision. **Reviewer** checks for bugs, security issues, performance, and maintainability. Reviewer labels issues as BLOCKING, WARNING, or NIT and tracks whether past feedback was incorporated.

```bash
cd templates/code-review
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env
bash dialogue.sh path/to/file-or-diff.patch
```

### research-validation

**Explorer** researches a topic deeply, finding new angles and connections. **Validator** fact-checks claims, catches contradictions across cycles, and labels issues as FACTUAL_ERROR, LOGICAL_ERROR, or GAP.

```bash
cd templates/research-validation
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env
bash dialogue.sh "the relationship between sleep deprivation and false memory formation"
```

### trading-strategy

**Strategist** proposes trade setups with entry, exit, stop, and thesis. **Risk Manager** stress-tests every setup, checks correlation/liquidity/event risk, and issues verdicts: APPROVED, REDUCE_SIZE, WIDEN_STOP, or REJECT.

```bash
cd templates/trading-strategy
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env
bash dialogue.sh "BTC consolidating at 65k, ETH/BTC ratio at 3-year low"
```

All templates support `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` for Slack posting.
